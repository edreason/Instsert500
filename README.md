DIY 500 series module for interfacing with effects pedals

Designed by Ed Reason // edreason@gmail.com

Overview:
The aim of this project is to create a 500 Series module that can be used to convert balanced
line level signals to unbalanced instrument level signals (and vice versa), for interfacing 
with guitar effects pedals. There will also be a number of quality of life features, such as:
- Separate send/receive level controls
- Wet/Dry mix control
- 9V PSU output, for powering pedals
- Input/Output signal indicator LEDs
